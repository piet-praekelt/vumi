HTTP Transport
==============

A simple API for submitting Vumi messages into Vumi.

Notes
~~~~~

Default allowed keys:

* `content`
* `to_addr`
* `from_addr`

Others can be allowed by specifying the `allowed_fields` in the configuration file.

There is no limit on the length of the content so if you are publishing to a length constrained transport such as SMS then you are responsible for limiting the length appropriately.

If you expect a reply from the `Application` that is dealing with these requests then set the `reply_expected` boolean to `true` in the config file. That will keep the HTTP connection open until a response is returned. The `content` of the reply message is used as the HTTP response body.
